Jekyll-Bliss: The Answer to Slow Compiles Time
---

# ⚠ WARNING: Not functional yet. ⚠

Jekyll is my favorite static site generator because it is very non-opinionated. The folder structure is super simplistic and feels natural.

However, there is one major problem with Jekyll: **The compile time**. If you have a small site, this may not be a problem, but once you start accumulating many posts, installing a variety of plugins and using many files that should be preprocessed, your compile time will skyrocket.

The aims of this project is to allow Jekyll-Bliss to do all of the heavy-lifting (Markdown, JS, Sass/SCSS, Pug compilation, etc) and allow Jekyll to do the smallest amount of work possible - compiling HTML files.
