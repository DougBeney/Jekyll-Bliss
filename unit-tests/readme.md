Jekyll-Bliss Unit Testing
---

For now, unit tests are not automated. This is a collection of Jekyll sites that throw different scenerios at Jekyll-Bliss.

To run, go into each directory (ex. `basic-site/`) and run `bliss b`. You just want to make sure the compiled output looks correct.

In the future, this will be automated.
